function D = dt(B)
% DT apply Eucledian distance transform
%    D = dt(B) compute the Eucledian distance transform of B
%    B must be a binary map. 
%
% NOTE: this is not an efficient way to implement distance transform. 
%    If one is interested in using DT, one may want to implement its
%    own DT.
